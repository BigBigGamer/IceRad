# GPM-DPR Ice detection
Python script for ice-masses detection and research using data from GPM DPR radar (About the [GPM](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/Gallery/GPM.html) mission).

## Structure
- **IceScanner** - contains main script for ice detection, as well as some test data.
- **Testing** - contains all sorts of things, which were used for testing some theories and different approaches to ice
  detection based on DPR data. Example-data is located here (dXXmXXyXXXXSXXXXXX).
- **Useful files** - a bunch of useful files related to remote ice detection.
- **Coursework** - my coursework on the subject (in russian), made with LaTeX.

## Usage
To use the main script (IceScanner/IceScanner.py), theese libraries are required
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- Basemap
- tkinter
